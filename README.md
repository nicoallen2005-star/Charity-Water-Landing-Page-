# Charity: Water — Campus Landing Page

This project is a **student-built landing page** inspired by [charity: water](https://www.charitywater.org/) as part of my class assignment.  
The goal is to demonstrate web design and development skills by transforming a Canva mockup into a live, interactive website using **HTML and CSS**.
